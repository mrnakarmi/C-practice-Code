# C-practice-Code
C++ practice code I use to practice for my interviews.

Lesson 1 - Big 0: Basic intro to figuring out the run times of programs.

Lesson 2 - Array Based List: Using abstract data structures to make an undordered list based on arrays.

Lesson 3 - Linked Lists: Same as lesson 2 but now using linked lists.

Lesson 4 - Array Based Stacks: A simple implementation of stacks using arrays.

Lesson 5 - Binary Search Trees: A binary search tree implemented using recursion.

Lesson 6 - Template Binary Search Trees: A binary search tree implemented through c++ templates and not using recursion.

Misc: Other practice files for programming questions.

- peak.cpp:  A program that finds the peak in an array (excludes corner cases).
- reverseStringSpecialCharacter.cpp: A program that reverses all the alphabets in a given string but ignores special characters.
- minimumDepthBinaryTree.cpp: A program that finds the minimum depth in a binary tree.
