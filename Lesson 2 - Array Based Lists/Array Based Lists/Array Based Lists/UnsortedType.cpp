    we need to find the item.

        Maybe delete it and shift everything in the array?
     
     Looping through, and finding the item, and then shifting is inefficient
     
     REMEMBER the array is unsorted! It just needs to reflect that the item is deleted and the length is adjusted.
     So we can just take the last element value and use it to overwrite the found item*/
